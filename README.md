# Winvite Manager (WIP)
Web-Invite Manager or short Winvite Manager will be an overengineered full stack management tool to create public available invites as website which include the following features:

Clientside (winvite part):
* modern ui made with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) delivered as fast single site application powered by [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
* enough possibilities (video, pictures, just text) to display all features of the advertised event
* a form with which users can register directly into the winwite. It will also be possible to sign up as a helper (helper system included)
* a publicly visible guest list
* language support for german and english
* darkmode

Serverside (management part):
* solid mvc server backend with [nestJS](https://nestjs.com/) paired with [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [express](https://expressjs.com/)
* straight forward winvite creation with instant view opportunity powered by [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* view and edit all registered guests with all details of your winvite
* account autorisation to privacy the sesible data of your winvites

### Demo
There is already a first [demo](https://github.com/EliasSchaut/Winvite-Demo) for a managed winvite (not all features are implemented yet).

## Misc
### Cloud
The source code will be open for everybody. However there will be a monetised option, that will host the project for you and will give you your own ssl encrypted subdomain of winvite.site for all of your winvites.

### Trivia
Winvite can also be interpreted as **invite** who **win**s the **invite**d which uses [**vite**](https://vitejs.dev/) to **win** also the **invite**r.\
